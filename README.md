## Usage and UI

All circles represent transactions (tx) in the IOTA Tangle.
A circular buffer is used to populate the viewer with the last 1800 (configurable) tx on page load.

Hover a tx to see more details:

- bottom left: value, tag, hash
- top left: how many tx are confirming the selcted one (yellow)
- top left: how many tx are confirmed by the selcted one (magenta)
- tx of the same bundle are highlightes in blue

Use the input boxes on the left to filter by hast, tag or bundle. The tag filter is applied using a regex.

Toggle switches on the top right:

### Configuration

In adition to setting configuration parameters using the ui, URL parameters can be used for presets.

**Example:**
`http://tangle.glumb.de/?DARK_MODE=true&CIRCLE_SIZE=40&HIGHLIGHT_COLOR_FORWARD="0xbada55ff"&svg`

**Syntax**
`http://tangle.glumb.de/?<CONFIG_PARAM_NAME>=<VALUE>[&<CONFIG_PARAM_NAME>=<VALUE>]`

**Available Configuration Parameters**

```json
CIRCLE_SIZE: 30, // size of a node
REMOVE_LONLY_AFTER_S: 30, // remove floating nodes after time
REMOVE_SMALLER_THAN_PERCENTAGE_OF_TOTAL_MESH: 0.03, // remove graphs that are smaller than % of all nodes
MAX_CIRCLE_SIZE: 80, // max node size used e.g. for 'size by value'
MAX_NODES: 4000, // max nodes when 'limit to 4k nodes' is enabled

// options

## Installation

Clone the repo and run `npm install`.

### Tangle Setup

The visualiser can be used for multiple networks (Mainnet, testnet, Customnet). The main entrypoint is the `<NAME>App.js` file.
To get started open the `mainnetApp.js` and configure the `ZMQ_ENDPOINT` and `LSM_NODE`.
Run `node mainnnetApp.js` to start the server. Done :)

To add another network, copy the `mainnetApp.js` and rename it to `<CustomName>App.js`. Copy the `mainnetdata.json` and also rename it to `<CustomName>data.json`.
Set your network endpoints in `<CustomName>App.js` and also set the `NAME` to `<CustomName>`.

## Architecture

The visualiser follows simple client server architecture. Server-side a ZMQ client is used for for data aquisition. It listens to the ZMQ Transaction stream of an IOTA Fullnode. An Instance of the IOTA JS library is used to peridically poll the latest milestone index.

Transactions are stroed in a ringbuffer to send the last 1800TX to the client on pageload.

## Telegram / Message Format

The data send to the client via WebSocket follow this structure:

**TX - Transaction**

```js
{
  hash,
  address,
  value,
  tag,
  timestamp,
  current_index,
  last_index,
  bundle_hash,
  transaction_trunk,
  transaction_branch
}
```

**SN - Confirmed Transaction**

```js
{
  hash,
  address,
  transaction_trunk,
  transaction_branch,
  bundle
}
```

### Socket IO Client Events

The clients data interface is based on the SocketIO library. Therefore it is server agnostic as along as the expected SocketIO events are emittet by the backend.

On initialisation/pageload the following events are expected:

```js
socket.emit("config", FRONTEND_CONFIG); // { networkName }
socket.emit("inittx", txArray); // see format above
socket.emit("initsn", snArray); // see format above
socket.emit("initms", mileStoneArray); // Array of milestone tx hashes
```

During runtime the following event can be fired:

```js
socket.emit("tx", tx); // see format above
socket.emit("sn", sn); // see format above
socket.emit("ms", ms); // milestone tx hash
```
